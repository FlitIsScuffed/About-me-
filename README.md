My preferred pronouns! More information on my pronoun.page;

Pronouns: Polygender + Xenogender (Pupgender + Fanggender); She, They, It, Pup, Fang.
(To add, I prefer genderneutrul pronouns usually but ofc I don't mind feminine pronouns.)

Basic information on what my identities are;

Polygender — A nonbinary gender identity where a person experiences more than one gender, either simultaneously or fluctuating between them. This can include any combination of genders, such as male, female, and various non-binary identities. Some polygender people may also express characteristics of multiple genders.

Pupgender (also known as Puppygender) — A xenogender identity where one's gender is connected to puppies or described as puppy-like, such as being small, lively, and cute. It is an umbrella term for various dog-associated genders and can be expressed in different ways, including through pronouns like "pup/pupself" or "paw/pawself".

Fanggender — A xenogender connected to the feeling of gender euphoria experienced from having or imagining having fangs

Before interacting, what you need to know is...

(1): I am animalhearted and a polytherian; so do not interact if you aren't comfortable with that!! I will not fucking tolerate ANY discrimination or "hunting season". Anyways; my theriotypes are the batearred fox, homing pigeon, and english mastiff. </3

(2): I have ADHD, which I have both traits of hyperactivity and Inattentive. Along with ADHD, I have anxiety and depression; both affect me very heavily.

(3): Currently getting tested for BPD (and I think for anything else I could have), so please bare with my bs lol.

(4): I am an atheist, aka I don't have any religious beliefs. If that's not okay with you then do not interact with me. I DO NOT judge my friends on their beliefs. But do tell me if I say anything disrespectful or hurtful.

(5): I am very prone to anger (+ crying) episodes; which accidentally results in physical violence irl at times.. (⁠;⁠ŏ⁠﹏⁠ŏ⁠)

To put this out; I do NOT do it on purpose, when I am going through those states — I have NO control of myself. I may have impulses to harm people (+ myself) but I do not wish to enjoy it. I don't want to hurt anyone without it being in self defense, especially towards someone I care about.

(6): I am a bit of a misanthrope; having very mildish fear/dislike for humankind. Idk what else to say about it so uh yeah.

(7): Response to "Why is mentally and bodily separate ages!?" You could figure it out yourself but whatever.. Short answer; I bacially grew up a lot quicker mentally than I am bodily. Use Google or something if you want a full on detailed answer.

(8): Only for VC based things; I have some trauma from VC so please bare with me when I don't want to unmute or have my camera on. Along with such — I have stuttering, volume management and mumbling problems.

(9): I am quite the shy person at first when it comes to talking/texting so you will probably have to start most conversations (⁠；⁠^⁠ω⁠^)

(10): I don't really have a censor, nor do I think before speaking/texting + sometimes I don't understand the effects of my actions at first; so PLEASE please please tell whenever I hurt your feelings or anything!

(11): I'm fine with being friends with adults who are below 25 (and the lowest is 11, I don't like young children ngl) but just don't push it. Exceptions for friends of my friends + knowing before becoming 25.

(12): Response to "Are you taken?" Yes, I am in a beautiful long distance relationship with my lover! They are Genderfluid and their preferred name is Sage btw <33

(13): I am very often found to be emotionless or detached if you will — feeling such is very common for me. To explain it; it feels like I'm missing something, like a rotting corpse. It can last hours to days; unless I get triggered ofc.

(14): I have a touching trigger, mostly from experiences online (but also applies to irl). Some of my friends are more trusted than others, which you'll would know if you are one of those friends.

TO ADD: There are some exceptions for me, such as if I think someone is in danger — I will let them hide behind me, especially in harassment situations.

(15): Despite the whole touch trigger; I am a VERY clingy and nosy person, I love cuddling but sometimes I feel like I get a little much towards my more trusted friends. Mb.

(16): Being the shy (+ sensitive) person that I am; I have a very hard time getting my boundaries across, which also triggers me because of my past experiences. I deeply apologize to anyone who gets/would get annoyed about that, I'm just a dumbass.

(17): I have mild/severe trust issues but can grow a bond rather quickly after that border is crossed. All that I recall about the reason why is because of my past experiences.

(18): A lot of my past experiences are starting/completely blurred in my memories. Even so, PLEASE please be mindful on what dark/triggering topics you speak about with me.

Recently I have been trying to slowly write down all that I remember about certain things. However, I would prefer to keep it to myself + between my close friends and I. (Even though I have no problem talking about certain things, oops.)

(19): Just a random thing for most people who don't know me irl but; I do NOT wish to associate with any part of my biological parents' families. I personally hate both VERY much, they are disgusting af. But to keep people from associating me with what they have done/said, I would appreciate not being asked about it.

(20): DNI and INT list(s);
